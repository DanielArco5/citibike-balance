# Project
Estimate censored bike demand, simulate station inventory, allocate a fixed
incentive budget to maximize fill rate. See SPEC.md for full design.

# Non-negotiables
- NEVER write code against an assumed schema. Print columns from the actual
  file first. Citi Bike schema changed ~Feb 2021.
- Every model function gets a test with a synthetic fixture where the answer
  is known analytically.
- No silent NaN drops. Log row counts before/after every filter and assert
  expected magnitude.
- Cache expensive steps to parquet keyed by content hash. Never re-parse raw
  CSVs in an interactive loop.
- Money and elasticity assumptions live in config/params.yaml, never inline.

# Commands
make ingest / make features / make train / make simulate / make allocate / make report

# Style
Polars or DuckDB for the heavy joins, pandas only at the edges.
